1) Open the notebook using google colab

2) please change the names of the following files:
	- from track_a/dev/eng to track_a/dev/dev_eng {basically change the file name of eng inside dev data from eng.csv to dev_eng.csv}

	- from track_a/dev/hin to track_a/dev/dev_hin {basically change the file name of hin inside dev data from hin.csv to dev_hin.csv}

	- from track_a/dev/mar to track_a/dev/dev_mar {basically change the file name of mar inside dev data from mar.csv to dev_mar.csv}

	- from track_a/train/eng to track_a/dev/train_eng {basically change the file name of eng inside train data from eng.csv to train_eng.csv}

	- from track_a/train/hin to track_a/dev/train_hin {basically change the file name of hin inside train data from hin.csv to train_hin.csv}

	- from track_a/train/mar to track_a/dev/train_mar {basically change the file name of mar inside train data from mar.csv to train_mar.csv}
	
3) Then upload each one of the single files i.e., dev_eng.csv, train_eng.csv, .. etc into the google colab's memory storage and then execute 

4) Can also be done on anaconda / local CPU if high SRAM / Stronger GPU is available.
